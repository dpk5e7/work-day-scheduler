# Work Day Scheduler

This project was built to satisfy the Module 05 Challenge for the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this challenge is to build a work day scheduler.

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library is used to work with date and time.

Note: The started code for this challenge referenced Bootstrap v4.3.1 & jQuery v3.4.1. These have been upgraded to Bootstrap v5.2 & jQuery v3.6.0.

### User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
